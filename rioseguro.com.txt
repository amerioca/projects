This site I'm doing as a favor for 3 police officers (2 retired)

I will need to make a site that explains what were about, and what we will try to do to keep the streets of Copacabana safer.

Mostly looking for donations... I already have 6000$R in donations per month, first these donations will be going to the police watching the area, as we grow, I can pay programmers and people that will administrate the site.
